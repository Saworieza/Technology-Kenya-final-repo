actually this one is to rant about things i disobeyed and added
1. the blog section, what are we even gonn blog about assuming we leave that
2. The team, twas a nice idea in my head
3. the portfolio... seems like a niceguy to show case what we have done and also floss that time line thingy

then i will really need a conc reason tommorow(later on today 11/8/14) not to scratch that stupid footer sesign and totally redesign it
then, its probably nothin much but could you find a way to make that thing on homes back move to the current page. thank you.. and its not nothing... its quite annoying. you forget which nav u r on when that idiot is just standing there
and you are not done yet with the homepage
Change the font style to something more beautiful, something artistic



then while you are at all these remember you promised the kids a website to go to incase of missed lessons... we either gonn do wordpress or go localhost... your choice
